# RickAndMorty
Catalisa's minicourse challenge 2022. Webpage to consume Rick and Morty's API. HTML, CSS and JS
The logic used for the challenge resolution was based on the creation of the class "card" to hold the information requested about the characters. Then, the constant "section" was created to manage each "card" be treated individually, using "for (let section of sections)"
The loop initiates when the user presses the button "botao", starting all the followed functions. 
Through the variable "temp", who holds the information of wich number of character was sorted, we can certify that there wasnt exist no repetition of character in each sort.
